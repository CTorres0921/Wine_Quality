README: Wine Quality Model Optimization

üìä Overview
This notebook demonstrates a machine learning workflow for predicting wine quality using various optimization techniques. The dataset includes physicochemical properties of wines and their associated quality ratings. The analysis involves model building, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

üìÅ Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following features:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol
- Quality (target variable)

üîç Workflow and Methods
The notebook follows these steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
   - Loaded the dataset and checked for missing values
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations

2. **Model Building**
   - Implemented multiple models including:
     - Decision Tree
     - Random Forest
     - Logistic Regression
     - Gradient Boosting

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Used accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices to evaluate model performance
   - Visualized results to compare model effectiveness

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Applied GridSearchCV to optimize key parameters for models
   - Evaluated tuned models for improvements

üìà Key Findings
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting classifiers generally provided the best performance on the wine quality prediction task.
- Feature importance plots revealed that alcohol, sulphates, and volatile acidity are among the top predictors of wine quality.
- Hyperparameter tuning improved model accuracy and generalization.
